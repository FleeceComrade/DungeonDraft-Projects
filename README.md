# TTRPG Maps Collection
⚠️ **THIS IS A README, *NOT* A LICENSE** ⚠️<br>
Welcome! This project is a collection of maps I created for my own personal TTRPG campaign(s). Since I put effort into making them, I figured I’d make them public in case others find them useful for their own games.

## Important Notes
- **I HAVE *NO* AFFILIATIONS with any software, assets, or their creators** that I reference in my work. Please do not ask me about purchasing, pricing, deals, or anything related to selling the tools or assets I use. Nor should you ask me for any contact info for the creators. 
- **PLEASE READ THE CREDITS** inside each map set/prefab folder for detailed attribution of the assets and software used in its creation.
- **I DO *NOT* TAKE REQUESTS or create custom maps for others.** These maps are made for my own use, and I’m sharing them as-is for anyone who might enjoy them—please do not ask for commissions, specific designs, or personalized maps.
- **Feel free to use these maps for your own NON-COMMERCIAL campaigns!** If they help make your game better, that’s great.

## Other Questions?
If you have genuine questions about the map files themselves—such as formatting, image compression, navigating my crazy folder structure, or my general creation process—feel free to reach out to me at **[fleececomrade@gmail.com](mailto:fleececomrade@gmail.com)**. However, I won’t be answering questions about my campaign, its story, or the lore behind the maps.

### Thanks and Enjoy!
